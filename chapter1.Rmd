## Variables assignment

In the script window on the upper right you should type the *R* code required for the exercises. When you hit the *Submit Answer* button, your *R* code is executed, and you get a message indicating whether your *R* code is correct. The output of your submission is shown in the *R* console on the lower right.

You can also execute *R* commands in the console on the lower right. When you type in the console, your submission will not be checked for correctness! Try, for example, to type in `2 + 1` and hit Enter. *R* should return `[1] 3`.

Variables are created by an assignment operation, and they don’t have to be declared, The standard assignment operator in R is the arrow symbol `<-`, R interprets text in quotes (`””`) as character strings, Text that is not in quotes (`””`) is interpreted as a symbol or expression, Typing a symbol or expression evaluates it.

*** =instructions
In the script window on the upper right, assign number 2 and a string "Hello World!" to variables, and hit the *Submit Answer* button.

*** =hint
The variable assignments are already presented, just type the variable name and check results. Remember not to add quotes to them!

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
#assign number to a variable
myvariable1 <- 2

#assign a string to a variable
myvariable2 <- "Hello World!"

# now write R code to check if the assignments are successfull
```

*** =solution
```{r}
#assign number to a variable
myvariable1 <- 2

#assign a string to a variable
myvariable2 <- "Hello World!"

# now write R code to check if the assignments are successfull
myvariable1
myvariable2

```

*** =sct
```{r}
success_msg("Awesome! See how the console shows the result of the R code you submitted?")
```

## Inserting comments into your code

*R* uses the hash `#` sign to mark text as comments.  
All text after the hash `#` sign is treated as a comment, and is not executed as code.  
For example, the text *Calculate 3 + 4* in the script window on the upper right is a comment and is ignored during execution.

*** =instructions
Add a line with the comment mark *#* and  text *myvariable <- 1*, in the script window.

*** =hint
Simply add the line `# add comments to myvariable <- 1` above the *R* code that assigns values *myvariable1 <- 2*.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
myvariable <- 10

#assign number to a variable
myvariable1 <- 2

#assign a string to a variable
myvariable2 <- "Hello World!"

#add comments


# now write R code to check if the assignments are successfull
```

*** =solution
```{r}
myvariable <- 10

#assign number to a variable
myvariable1 <- 2

#assign a string to a variable
myvariable2 <- "Hello World!"

#add comments
#myvariable <- 1

# now write R code to check if the assignments are successfull
myvariable
myvariable1
myvariable2
```

*** =sct
```{r}
success_msg("Awesome! See? That assignment in the comment does not take effect.")

## Explore sessions in R

R session has many default settings, which you can learn to configure or make use of.

The function getwd() returns a vector of length 1, with the ﬁrst element containing a string with the name of the current working directory (cwd).
The function setwd() accepts a character string as input (the name of the directory), and sets the working directory to that string. 
With Sys.time() you can get system time with time zone of the R session; or you can just get system date with Sys.Date().

*** =instructions
Type the function getwd(), Sys.time() and Sys.Date().

*** =hint
Simply the function name, copy & paste.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec

## Environment Variables

R uses environment variables to store information about its environment, such as paths to directories containing ﬁles used by R (startup, history, OS).
For example the environment variables: 
R USER and HOME store the R user Home directory, 
R HOME stores the root directory of the R installation, 
The functions Sys.getenv() and Sys.setenv() display and set the values environment variables, 
Sys.getenv("env var") displays the environment variable "env var", 
Sys.setenv("env var=value") sets the environment variable "env var" equal to "value",


*** =instructions
Change parameters as instructed and see the results.

*** =hint
Simply copy the function name and change parameters inside.

## Global Options Settings

R uses a list of global options which aﬀect how R computes and displays results.
The function options() either sets or displays the values of global options: 
  options("globop") displays the current value of option "globop";
  getOption("globop") displays the current value of option "globop";
  options(globop=value) sets the option "globop" equal to "value";

## The R Workspace

The workspace is the current R working environment, which includes all user-deﬁned objects and the command history.
The function ls() returns names of objects in the R workspace.
The function rm() removes objects from the R workspace.
The workspace can be saved into and loaded back from an *.RData ﬁle (binary ﬁle format).
The function save.image() saves the whole workspace. 
The function save() saves just the selected objects.
The function load() reads data from *.RData ﬁles, and invisibly returns a vector of names of objects created in the workspace.

When you quit R you’ll be prompted ”Save workspace image?” If you answer YES then the workspace will be saved into the .RData ﬁle in the cwd, When you start R again, the workspace will be automatically loaded from the existing .RData ﬁle,

The function history() displays recent commands, You can also save and load the command history from a ﬁle.

*** =instructions
Type the function ls() and rm().

*** =hint
Simply the function name, copy & paste as instructed by comments.

## Data Objects in R

All data objects in R are vectors, or consist of vectors.
Single numbers and character strings are vectors of length "1".
Atomic vectors are homogeneous objects whose elements are all of the same mode (type).
Lists and data frames are recursive (heterogeneous) objects, whose elements can be vectors of diﬀerent mode.
The functions is.atomic() and is.recursive() return logical values depending on whether their arguments are atomic or recursive.

*** =instructions
Use function is.atomic() and is.recursive() to check whether the object is atomic or recursive.

*** =hint
Check if object names and function names are correctly typed.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
#define objects of single number, vector, list and dataframe
v1 <- 1
v2 <- 1:10
v3 <- list(aa=c('a', 'b'), bb=1:5)
v4 <- data.frame(aa=c('a', 'b'), bb=1:2)

#find out if single number is atomic or recursive
is.atomic(v1)
is.recursive(v1)

#find out if vector is atomic or recursive
is.atomic(v2)
is.recursive(v2)

#now use similar process to find out if list is atomic or recursive


#do the same to data frame

## Type, Mode, and Class of Objects

The type, mode, and class are character strings representing various object properties.
The type of an atomic object represents how it’s stored in memory (logical, character, integer, double, etc.)
The mode of an atomic object is the kind of data it represents (logical, character, numeric, etc.)
The mode of an object often coincides with its type (except for integer and double types)
Recursive objects (lists, data frames) have both type and mode equal to the recursive type (list)
The class of an object is given by either an explicit class attribute, or is derived from the object mode and its dim attribute (implicit class)
The function class() returns the explicit or implicit class of an object.
The object class is used for method dispatching in the S3 object-oriented programming system in R

*** =instructions
Use function typeof(), mode() and class() to explore object type, mode and class.

*** =hint
Check if object names and function names are correctly typed.

## R Object Attributes

R objects can have diﬀerent attributes, such as: names, dimnames, dimensions, class, etc.
The attributes of an object is a named list of symbol=value pairs.
The function attributes() returns the attributes of an object.
The attributes of an R object can be modiﬁed using the "attributes()" assignment.

The function structure() adds attributes (speciﬁed as symbol=value pairs) to an object, and returns it.
A vector that is assigned an attribute other than names is not treated as a vector.
The function is.vector() returns TRUE if its argument is a vector, and returns FALSE otherwise,


*** =instructions
Use function attributes(), structure() and is.vector() to explore object attributes.

*** =hint
Check if object names and function names are correctly typed.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
#a simple vector has no attributes

#modify the attributes of an object
attributes(my_var) <- list(class = "Date")

#print the object and see what's changed
my_var

#also we can use structure to change attributes
structure(1:10, class = "Date")

#now use attributes assignment method to change the class attributes of a list to character

## Arithmetric calculation in R

In its most basic form *R* can be used as a scientific calculator. Consider the following arithmetic operators:

+ Addition: `+`
+ Subtraction: `-`
+ Multiplication: `*`
+ Division: `/`
+ Exponentiation: `^` and `**`
+ Modulo: `%%`

The last two might need some explaining:
- The `^` operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right: for example `3^2` equals 9.
- The modulo returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right, for example 5 modulo 3 or `5 %% 3` equals 2.

*** =instructions
- Type `2^5` in the script window to calculate 2 to the power 5.
- Type `28 %% 6` to calculate 28 modulo 6.
- Click *Submit Answer* and have a look at the *R* output in the console.

*** =hint
Another example of the modulo operator: `9 %% 2` equals `1`.

## Variable assignment (1)

A variable allows you store a value or an object in R. You can then later use this variable's name to easily access the value or the object that is stored within this variable. You use `<-` to assign a variable:

```
my_variable <- 4
```

*** =instructions
Complete the code in the editor such that it assigns the value 42 to the variable `x` in the editor. Click 'Submit Answer'. Notice that when you ask *R* to print `x`, the value 42 appears.

*** =hint
Look at how the value 4 was assigned to `my_variable` in the exercise's assignment. Do the exact same thing in the editor, but now assign 42 to the variable `x`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Assign the value 42 to x
x <- 

# Print out the value of the variable x
x
```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Assign the value 42 to x
x <- 42

# Print out the value of the variable x
x
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_error()
test_object("x", 
            undefined_msg = "Make sure to define a variable <code>x</code>.",
            incorrect_msg = "Make sure that you assign the correct value to <code>x</code>.") 
success_msg("Good job! Notice that R does not print the value of a variable to the console when you do the assignment. <code>x <- 42</code> did not generate any output, because R assumes that you will be needing this variable in the future. Otherwise you wouldn't have stored the value in a variable in the first place, right? Proceed to the next exercise!")
```

## Variable assignment (2)

Suppose you have a fruit basket with five apples. You want to store the number of apples in a variable with the name `my_apples`. 

*** =instructions
- Using `<-`, assign the value 5 to `my_apples` below the first comment.
- Type `my_apples` below the second comment. This will print out the value of `my_apples`.
- After clicking *Submit Answer*, have a look at the console: the number 5 is printed, so *R* now links the variable `my_apples` to the value 5.

*** =hint
Remember that if you want to assign a number or an object to a variable in R, you can make use of the assignment operator `<-`. Alternatively, you can use `=`, but `<-` is widely preferred in the *R* community.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Assign the value 5 to the variable called my_apples


# Print out the value of the variable my_apples

```

```{r}
# Assign the value 5 to the variable called my_apples
my_apples <- 5

# Print out the value of the variable my_apples
my_apples
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_object("my_apples", incorrect_msg = "Have you correctly assigned 5 to `my_apples`? Write `my_apples <- 5` on a new line in the script window.")
test_output_contains("my_apples", incorrect_msg = "Have you explicitly told R to print out the `my_apples` variable to the console? Simply type `my_apples` on a new line.")

## Variable assignment (3)

Every tasty fruit basket needs oranges, so you decide to add six oranges. You decide to create the variable `my_oranges` and assign the value 6 to it. Next, you want to calculate how many pieces of fruit you have in total. Since you have given meaningful names to these values, you can now code this in a clear way:

```
my_apples + my_oranges
```

*** =instructions
- Assign to `my_oranges` the value 6.
- Add the variables `my_apples` and `my_oranges` and have *R* simply print the result.
- Combine the variables `my_apples` and `my_oranges` into a new variable `my_fruit`, which is the total amount of fruits in your fruit basket.

*** =hint
`my_fruit` is just the sum of `my_apples` and `my_oranges`. You can use the `+` operator to sum the two and `<-` to assign that value to the variable `my_fruit`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Assign 5 to my_apples
my_apples <- 5

# Assign 6 to my_oranges

# Add my_apples and my_oranges: assign to my_fruit

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Assign 5 to my_apples
my_apples <- 5

# Assign 6 to my_oranges
my_oranges <- 6

# Add my_apples and my_oranges: print the result
my_apples + my_oranges

# Add my_apples and my_oranges: assign to my_fruit
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges
```

## jingtao's first R script

In the script window on the upper right you should type the *R* code required for the exercises. When you hit the *Submit Answer* button, your *R* code is executed, and you get a message indicating whether your *R* code is correct. The output of your submission is shown in the *R* console on the lower right.

You can also execute *R* commands in the console on the lower right. When you type in the console, your submission will not be checked for correctness! Try, for example, to type in `2 * 3` and hit Enter. *R* should return `[1] 6`.

*** =instructions
In the script window on the upper right, add another line of code that calculates the product of 2 times 3, and hit the *Submit Answer* button.

## The workspace

If you assign a value to a variable, this variable is stored in the workspace. It's the place where all user-defined variables live. The command [`ls()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/ls) lists the contents of this workspace. 

```
a <- 1
b <- 2
ls()
```

The first two lines create the variables `a` and `b`. Calling [`ls()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/ls) now shows you that `a` and `b` are in the workspace. 

You can also remove variables from the workspace. You do this with [`rm()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/rm). `rm(a)`, for example, would remove `a` from the workspace again. `rm(list = ls())`, which is used in the beginning of your script, clears everything from the workspace.

*** =instructions
- Create a variable, `horses`, equal to 3, and a variable `dogs`, equal to 7.
- List the contents of your workspace with [`ls()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/ls) to see that indeed, these two variables are in there.

## Discover Basic Data Types

To get started, here are some of R's most basic data types:

- Decimal values like `4.5` are called **numerics**.
- Natural numbers like `4L` are called **integers**. Integers are also numerics.
- Boolean values (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) are called **logical**. Capital letters are important here; `true` and `false` are not valid.
- Text (or string) values are called **characters**.

Note how the quotation marks on the right indicate that `"some text"` is of type character.

*** =instructions
Change the value of the:

- `my_numeric` variable to `42`.
- `my_character` variable to `"forty-two"`. Note that the quotation marks indicate that `"forty-two"` is a character.
- `my_logical` variable to `FALSE`.

*** =hint 
Replace the values in the script window with the values that are provided in the exercise.
```
my_numeric <- 42
```
assigns the value 42 to the variable `my_numeric`. 

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# What is the answer to the universe?
my_numeric <- 42.5

# The quotation marks indicate that the variable is of type character
my_character <- "some text"

# Change the value of my_logical
my_logical <- TRUE
```

*** =solution
```{r}
# What is the answer to the universe?
my_numeric <- 42

# The quotation marks indicate that the variable is of type character
my_character <- "forty-two"

# Change the value of my_logical
my_logical <- FALSE
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_object("my_numeric", 
            incorrect_msg = "Make sure that you assign the correct value to `my_numeric.`")
test_object("my_character",
            incorrect_msg = paste("Make sure that you assign the correct value to `my_character`.",
                                  "Do not forget the quotes and beware of capitalization! R is case sensitive!"))
test_object("my_logical",
            undefined_msg = "Please make sure to define a variable `my_logical`.",
            incorrect_msg = "Make sure that you assign the correct value to `my_logical`.") 
success_msg("Great work! Continue to the next exercise.")
```

## Back to Apples and Oranges

Common knowledge tells you not to add apples and oranges. But hey, that is what you just did! The `my_apples` and `my_oranges` variables both contained a number in the previous exercise. The `+` operator works with numeric variables in R. 

However, if you try to add a numeric and a character string, *R* will complain.

*** =instructions
- Click *Submit Answer* and read the error message. Make sure you understand why this did not work.
- Adjust `my_oranges <- "six"` such that *R* knows you have 6 oranges and thus a fruit basket with 11 pieces of fruit. Click *Submit Answer* again.

*** =hint
You have to assign the numeric value `6` to the `my_oranges` variable instead of the character value `"six"`. Notice how the quotation marks are used to indicate that `"six"` is a character.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Assign a value to the variable my_apples and print it out
my_apples <- 5
my_apples       

# Assign a value to the variable my_oranges and print it out
my_oranges <- "six" 
my_oranges 

# New variable that contains the total amount of fruit
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges 
my_fruit
```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Assign a value to the variable my_apples and print it out
my_apples <- 5  
my_apples  

# Assign a value to the variable my_oranges and print it out
my_oranges <- 6
my_oranges 

# New variable that contains the total amount of fruit
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges 
my_fruit
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_object("my_apples", incorrect_msg = "Don't change the code that assigns 5 to `my_apples`.")
test_object("my_oranges", incorrect_msg = "Change the assignment of the `my_oranges` variable such that the code runs without errors.")
test_object("my_fruit", 
            undefined_msg = "Please make sure to define a variable `my_fruit`.",
            incorrect_msg = "Make sure that you assign the correct value to `my_fruit`.")
test_output_contains("my_fruit", incorrect_msg = "The output does not contain the result of adding `my_apples` and `my_oranges`.")
success_msg("Awesome, keep up the good work!")
```

## What's that data type?

When you added the variables containing `5` and `"six"`, you got an error due to a mismatch in data types. You can avoid such embarrassing situations by checking the data type of a variable beforehand:

```
class(my_var)
```

In the workspace (you can see what it contains by typing [`ls()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/ls) in the console), some variables have already been defined. Which statement concerning these variables are correct?

*** =instructions
- `a`'s class is `integer`, `b` is a `character`, `c` is a `boolean`.
- `a`'s class is `character`, `b` is a `character` as well, `c` is a `logical`.
- `a`'s class is `numeric`, `b` is a `string`, `c` is a `logical`.
- `a`'s class is `numeric`, `b` is a `character`, `c` is a `logical`.

*** =hint
You can find out the data type of the `a` variable for example by typing `class(a)`. You can do similar things for `b` and `c`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
a <- 42
b <- "forty-two"
c <- FALSE
```

*** =sct
```{r}
msg1 <- "`boolean` is not the class for logical values. Try again."
msg2 <- "`a` is of the class `numeric`, give it another go."
msg3 <- "`string` is not a class in R. `character` is!"
msg4 <- "Nice one. Let's step it up a notch and start coercing variables!"
test_mc(correct=4, feedback_msgs = c(msg1, msg2, msg3, msg4))
```

## Coercion: Taming your data

As Filip explained in the video, coercion to transform your data from one type to another is perfectly possible. Next to the [`class()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/class) function and the `is.*()` functions, you can use the `as.*()` functions to force data to change types.

Take this example:

```
var <- "3"
var_num <- as.numeric(var)
```

`var`, a character string, is converted into a numeric using [`as.numeric()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/numeric). The resulting numeric is stored as `var_num`.

*** =instructions
- Convert `var`, a logical, to a character. Assign to resulting character string to the variable `var_char`.
- Inspect the class of `var_char` by using [`class()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/class) on it.

*** =hints
Use the [`as.character()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/character) function to convert `var` to a character.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Definition of var
var <- TRUE

# Convert var to a character: var_char


# Display the class of var_char


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Definition of var
var <- TRUE

# Convert var to a character: var_char
var_char <- as.character(var)

# Display the class of var_char
class(var_char)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_error()
msg <- "Do not remove or change the definition of the variable `var`."
test_object("var", undefined_msg = msg, incorrect_msg = msg)
test_function("as.character", "x",
              not_called_msg = "Make sure to call the function [`as.character()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/character) to convert `var` to a character.",
              incorrect_msg = "Have you passed the correct variable to the function [`as.character()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/character)?")
test_object("var_char")
test_function("class", "x", 
              not_called_msg = "Make sure to call the function <code>class()</code> to inspect the class of <code>var_char</code>.",
              incorrect_msg = "Have you passed the correct variable to the function <code>class()/<code>?")
success_msg("Bellissimo!")
```
