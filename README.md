## Getting Started  

The DataCamp course consists of multiple vignettes designed to teach a particular element of the R language.  
Each vignette consists of narrative text, R code, and instructions, followed by simple exercises designed to test the programming knowledge that the student has acquired.  The student must pass the exercises before she can procede to the next vignette.  

*Happy learning!*
