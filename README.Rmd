### Introduction to *R*  

This is a beginner <a href=https://www.datacamp.com target="_blank">DataCamp</a> course in *R*, designed to introduce students to the basics of the *R* programming language.  
The *DataCamp* course consists of multiple exercises, each designed to teach a particular element of the *R* language.  
Each exercise consists of narrative text, *R* code, and instructions, followed by a simple assignment designed to test the programming knowledge that the student has acquired.  
The student must pass the tests before she can procede to the next exercise.

### How to Create a *DataCamp* Course  

*DataCamp* has built a programming framework that allows users to create their own *DataCamp* courses as follows:  

+ *DataCamp* course files reside on *GitHub*, so the first step is to create an empty *GitHub* repository for the new course in your *GitHub* account,  

+ Then install *GitHub Desktop* on your computer,  

+ Next clone the new empty repository from the *GitHub* website to a directory on your computer (which is called the local repository),  

+ Populate the local repository with the files *course.yml* and *README.Rmd*, and individual *\*.Rmd* files for each course chapter,  

+ Add the sub-directories named *slides*, *img*, and *datasets* to the local repository,  

+ From *GitHub Desktop* on your computer synchronize the *GitHub* repository with the local repository,  

+ Go to the *DataCamp* website: <https://www.datacamp.com/teach/repositories>, and under "Create a *DataCamp* course", select "link existing *GitHub* repository" (before that your *DataCamp* account should be linked to your *GitHub* account),  

Once your *GitHub* repository is linked to *DataCamp*, then *DataCamp* will automatically build the course and host it on its website.  You can find the web link to the course on <https://www.datacamp.com/teach/repositories>.
